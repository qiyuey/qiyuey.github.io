## Introduction

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share my story with you.

I'm a post-2000s programmer born in Beijing, China, and I'm currently living and working in the heart of Silicon Valley. As someone born in the early 2000s, I've grown up alongside the rapid evolution of technology, from witnessing the rise of smartphones to experiencing the current AI revolution firsthand.

### My Journey from Beijing to Silicon Valley

Growing up in Beijing, I was always fascinated by technology. I started getting exposed to programming very early, even during my elementary school years, when I became curious about how computer systems worked. By middle school, I was already experimenting with basic programming concepts, and my passion really took off in high school when I started learning Python to automate some of my homework tasks - typical lazy programmer mindset, right?

I pursued my Computer Science degree at a top university in Beijing, where I specialized in software engineering. During university, I participated in several hackathons and programming competitions, including ACM-ICPC regionals. Those late-night coding sessions fueled by ramen and energy drinks became some of my fondest memories, even though they probably weren't the healthiest lifestyle choices!

The opportunity to come to Silicon Valley came when I decided to pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science at a top university here. What started as an academic journey to deepen my knowledge in advanced computing topics has opened up incredible opportunities in the tech industry. The transition wasn't easy - adjusting to a completely different academic and cultural environment, improving my English communication skills, and navigating life in a new country while being thousands of miles away from family and friends back home.

### Current Life in Silicon Valley

During my Master's studies, I secured a position as a software engineer at a tech company in the Bay Area, primarily focused on backend systems and distributed architectures. My daily routine involves a lot of Java and Python, containerization with Docker, and managing microservices on AWS. The fast-paced environment here is both challenging and exhilarating - every day brings new problems to solve and technologies to learn, complementing my graduate coursework perfectly.

Living in Silicon Valley has been an incredible experience. The diversity here is amazing - I work with colleagues from all over the world, and every lunch conversation feels like a mini cultural exchange. I've learned to appreciate good coffee (something I never cared about in Beijing), started hiking on weekends (the Bay Area trails are gorgeous!), and even picked up some basic Spanish from my roommate.

### The AI Transition

Here's where things get really interesting. Like many developers in Silicon Valley, I've been swept up in the AI wave that's transforming our industry. What started as curiosity about ChatGPT and other LLMs has evolved into a serious career pivot.

I'm currently dedicating my evenings and weekends to deepening my knowledge in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I've been working through Stanford's CS229 course materials, experimenting with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and building small projects to understand everything from computer vision to natural language processing. My latest project involves fine-tuning open-source models for Chinese-English translation - combining my linguistic background with technical skills.

The transition isn't just about learning new technologies; it's about shifting my entire mindset from traditional software development to thinking in terms of data, models, and probabilistic outcomes. Sometimes I feel like I'm back in university again, constantly learning and experimenting.

### What Drives Me

What excites me most about AI is its potential to bridge cultures and solve real-world problems. Having lived in both China and the US, I've seen how technology can connect people across different backgrounds. I'm particularly interested in how AI can improve cross-cultural communication and make technology more accessible to non-English speakers.

I'm also passionate about the ethical implications of AI development. As someone from a different cultural background working in Silicon Valley, I bring a unique perspective to discussions about AI bias, fairness, and global impact.

### Looking Forward

My goal is to transition into an AI/ML engineering role within the next year. I'm currently working on several open-source contributions and building a portfolio of projects that showcase my growing expertise in this field. My Master's program has been instrumental in providing the theoretical foundation, and I'm focusing on specializing more in AI/ML coursework while gaining practical experience through projects and research.

This blog will document my journey - the successes, failures, late-night debugging sessions, and everything in between. I hope my experiences can be helpful to other international developers making similar transitions, and I'd love to connect with anyone who's on a similar path.

### My Love for Travel

One passion that has shaped my worldview since childhood is traveling. I've been fortunate to explore multiple countries across Asia, Europe, and North America, and each journey has broadened my perspective in ways that complement my technical career.

In Asia, beyond my home country of China, I've wandered through the bustling streets of Tokyo, experienced the vibrant tech scene in Seoul, and marveled at the architectural wonders of Singapore. These trips helped me understand different approaches to technology and innovation across Asian cultures.

My European adventures took me through the historical cities of London and Paris, where I was fascinated by how ancient architecture coexists with modern tech hubs. I've also explored the Nordic countries, particularly enjoying the work-life balance philosophy in Stockholm and Copenhagen - something that has influenced how I approach my career in Silicon Valley.

Here in North America, living in the US has been an extended travel experience in itself. Beyond the Bay Area, I've road-tripped along the Pacific Coast Highway, experienced the energy of New York City's tech scene, and visited Canada multiple times, particularly loving the natural beauty of Vancouver and the multicultural vibe of Toronto.

These travel experiences have given me a unique perspective on global technology trends and cultural differences in how people approach innovation. They've also made me more adaptable - skills that have been invaluable during my transition from Beijing to Silicon Valley and now into the AI field.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Exploring Bay Area hiking trails (my favorite so far is the Mist Trail in Yosemite)
- Planning my next travel adventure (currently eyeing South America!)
- Trying new boba shops (Silicon Valley has surprisingly good options!)
- Playing basketball at local courts (keeping the Beijing street ball spirit alive)
- Learning to cook American dishes while missing my mom's dumplings

### Let's Connect!

I believe the best part of being in tech is the community. Whether you're a fellow international developer, someone interested in AI, or just want to chat about code, culture, or anything in between, I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks for taking the time to read my story. Here's to the journey ahead! ðŸš€
